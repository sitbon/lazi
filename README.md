# Lazi: Lazy Imports Everywhere

An easy way to implement and track lazy imports globally.

No external dependencies.

**Requres Python 3.11.**

## Usage:

```shell
poetry add lazi
```

```python
"""Automatic lazy loading example.

Install django to run, or change the imports.
"""
import lazi.auto as lazi         # Install import tracking.
import django.test               # Import stuff.
# print(lazi.used_count())         # Count loaded modules. <Not yet re-implemented>
TestCase = django.test.TestCase  # Trigger lazy loading.
# print(lazi.used_count())         # More modules were lazy loaded. <TBD>
```

```shell
python example.py
```

```python
0
262
```

```python
"""Manual lazy loading example.
"""
import lazi.core as lazi                # Import Lazi.
django = lazi.lazy("django")            # Import stuff.
django_test = lazi.lazy("django.test")  # Import more stuff.
# print(lazi.used_count())              # Count loaded modules. <TBD>
TestCase = django_test.TestCase         # Trigger lazy loading.
# print(lazi.used_count())              # Module was lazy loaded. <TBD>
```

```python

```

## Configuration

The `lazi.conf` namespace package contains configuration modules
that get autoloaded (in import order) by `lazi.conf.conf`.
It is fully decoupled from the rest of the codebase.

As a result, it's possible configure Lazi by creating `lazi.conf`
modules in your project (within the `lazi.conf` namespace package),
and use conf modules provided by other packages.

Configuration is not yet controllable via environment variables,
but this is planned for the future. Update: Supported for DEBUG_TRACING.

It's also possible to manually change the configuration at runtime,
with the caveat that some variables may have already been used by
`lazi.core`. To avoid this, configure Lazi before importing it:

```python
from lazi.conf import conf
conf.DEBUG_TRACING = True
import lazi.auto
# ...
```
