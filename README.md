# Lazi: Lazy Imports Everywhere

An easy way to implement and track lazy imports globally.

No external dependencies.

**Requres Python 3.11.**

## Usage:

```shell
poetry add lazi
```
```shell
DEBUG_TRACING=1 python3
```
```pycon
# (lazi-py3.11) lazi Î» DEBUG_TRACING=1 python
Python 3.11.2 (main, Mar 13 2023, 12:18:29) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux
>>> import lazi.auto
+ Finder[140307315610192] <refs:0> <inst:0>
>>> from django import test
<attr> django[.test] <L:State.LAZY>
...  # A lot of output
<class 'django.test.testcases.TestCase'>
>>>
```

### Use for specific modules:

```pycon
>>> from lazi.core import lazi
>>> with lazi:
...   import django
...   print(django.VERSION)
... 
(4, 2, 1, 'final', 0)
>>> _
```

Or:

```pycon
>>> from lazi.core import lazy
>>> django = lazy("django")
>>> django.VERSION
(4, 2, 1, 'final', 0)
>>> _
```

## Configuration

The `lazi.conf` namespace package contains configuration modules
that get autoloaded (in import order) by `lazi.conf.conf`.
It is fully decoupled from the rest of the codebase.

As a result, it's possible configure Lazi by creating `lazi.conf`
modules in your project (within the `lazi.conf` namespace package),
and use conf modules provided by other packages.

Configuration is not yet controllable via environment variables,
but this is planned for the future. Update: Supported for DEBUG_TRACING.

It's also possible to manually change the configuration at runtime,
with the caveat that some variables may have already been used by
`lazi.core`. To avoid this, configure Lazi before importing it:

```python
from lazi.conf import conf
conf.DEBUG_TRACING = 1
import lazi.auto
# ...
```
